"subject/Particpants" [sic] --> "Subject/Participant"
---------------------
>>> Participant (C0679646) - Someone who takes part in an activity.
Entity With Role in Clinical Study (C4723954) - A person or entity with a role in a clinical study. NOTE: Participant is used with growing frequency in some clinical and patient-facing documents like the informed consent form, Plain Language Summaries of study results, and publications. Subject or patient are terms used in regulatory guidelines, databases, other clinical research documents, or systems to refer to study participants. See also human subject, patient, study participant.
>>> Study Participant (C4554048) - Any individiual that has a role in a study, including study personnel and study subjects.
program participant (C0682346)
Clinical trial participant (person) (C1997894) - A living person who is observed, analyzed, examined, investigated, experimented upon, and/or treated in the course of a clinical trial. This includes studies where an investigator obtains identifiable private information or data through the intervention or interaction with the individual.
>>> Study Subject (C0681850) - A matter or an individual that is observed, analyzed, examined, investigated, experimented upon, or/and treated in the course of a particular study.
Human Study Subject (C2349001) - A living individual about whom an investigator conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual or through identifiable private information.
Investigative Subject (C2697811) - An entity, either biologic or otherwise, of interest in an investigation.
Subject -direct target (C1550501) - The principle target on which the action happens.Examples:The patient in physical examination, a specimen in a lab observation. May also be a patient's family member (teaching) or a device or room (cleaning, disinfecting, housekeeping).UsageNotes:Not all direct targets are subjects. Consumables and devices used as tools for an act are not subjects. However, a device may be a subject of a maintenance action.
Research Subject (C0080105) - Persons who are enrolled in research studies or who are otherwise the subjects of research.
Data Subject (C4684632) - An individual who is the subject of personal data, persons to whom data refers. [ISO/TS 25237:2008]
living subject (C1552741) - Anything that essentially has the property of life, independent of current state (a dead human corpse is still essentially a living subject).
Case Subject (C1698493) - A person, non-person living subject, or place that is the subject of an investigation related to a notifiable condition (health circumstance that is reportable within the applicable public health jurisdiction)

"amount"

>>> Quantity (C1265611) - How much there is of something that you can measure; the total amount or number.
Substance amount (C1264637)
Amount class - Amount (C1561574)

"Glycosylated Hemoglobin"
----------------------------------
>>> Hemoglobin, Glycosylated (C0017853)

Hemoglobin, Glycosylated (C0017853) [NOT UNIQUE, SEE "GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN"]
Glycated Hemoglobin A1c (C4505389)  [NOT UNIQUE, SEE "GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN"]

"blood"
-------
>>> Blood (C0005767) - The body fluid that circulates in the vascular system (BLOOD VESSELS). Whole blood includes PLASMA and BLOOD CELLS.
In Blood (C0005768) - Used for the presence or analysis of substances in the blood; also for examination of, or changes in, the blood in disease states. It excludes serodiagnosis, for which the subheading "diagnosis" is used, and serology, for which "immunology" is used.

"Laboratory procedure"
----------------------
>>> Laboratory Procedures (C0022885) - Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.
Laboratory Diagnostic Procedure (C1254361)
Laboratory observation (C4283904) -  The results of observations generated by laboratories. Laboratory results are typically generated by laboratories providing analytic services in areas such as chemistry, hematology, serology, histology, cytology, anatomic pathology, microbiology, and/or virology. These observations are based on analysis of specimens obtained from the patient and submitted to the laboratory.

"Procedure"
